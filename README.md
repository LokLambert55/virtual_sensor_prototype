# Virtual Sensor Prototype (Python)

This project demonstrates a virtual sensor (data-driven) pipeline:
- synthetic dataset generation
- feature engineering
- training and evaluating simple ML models to predict a hidden physical quantity (e.g. load/torque)
- baseline comparison (Ridge vs RandomForest)
- saving model and plots

This repository is part of my engineering portfolio (MEMS, sensors, embedded systems).

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
2. Generate data:
3. Train and evaluate:
4. Open the notebook for interactive exploration:

## What to look for
- `data/virtual_sensor_data.csv` — synthetic dataset
- `models/virtual_sensor_ridge.joblib` — saved Ridge model after training
- `images/` — plots visualizing predictions
